This plugin provides a proper means of backing up an SQLite database that
may or may not be in use.  The backup dumps the SQLite database into pure
ASCII SQL text that can then be archived safely.

To enable backups simply add a backup set similar to:

    [holland:backup]
    plugin = sqlite

    [sqlite]    
    databases = /path/to/sqlite_database1.db, /path/to/sqlite_database2.db 
    binary = /usr/bin/sqlite3
