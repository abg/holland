holland.lib.common
==================

This package provides common libraries used by various holland plugins and
would not otherwise be used by the core holland framework, or depends on
platform specific behavior.

The current modules in holland.lib.common as of this writing are:

* holland.lib.archive - Generic support for archiving files using zip and tar
* holland.lib.compression - file like object that wrap compression commands.
                            These are used heavily by plugins that compress
                            output as part of calling some other program using
                            the python standard subprocess module.
* holland.lib.safefilename - encode filenames in a portable, decodable way
                             This module is primarily used by the mysqldump
                             plugin in order to ensure that database names
                             from MySQL will always map to safe filenames.
                             Unicode or otherwise invalid database names are
                             always encoded through safefilename.  Please see
                             the holland-mysqldump plugin for more information.
* holland.lib.which - Trent Mick's ``which`` module. A portable way to lookup
                      commands on a system path. Similar to the command 
                      'which', but also works on Windows and implemented in
                      pure python.
